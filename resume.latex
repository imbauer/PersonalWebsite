% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space

\begin{tightemize}
\item Worked in a development team where we used agile methodologies to develop micro-services in order to manage delivery trucks and parcel delivery.  Completed stories and made bug fixes using Java Spring Boot and ExtJS based on the business requirements provided to us
\item Designed an end-to-end test for the Logistics department with Python and Robot Framework, test results run and stored in Jenkins
\item Built an API that accepts an application name, queries JIRA for all required applications, and either deploys them on Mesos Marathon, or scales them down. Improved efficiency for developers testing changes and decreased hosting costs
\item Optimized Docker Build Slave image sizes for Jenkins by consolidating multiple small and simple images into the base image, reducing the number of layers on each image, and removing outdated and unused images.  Build and push time reduced by \textasciitilde{}50\%
